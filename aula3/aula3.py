# The most common to use ...
print("This a 'string' (str).")
print('This a "string" (str).')

# Here we are using character '\' to scape like below
print("This my \"text\"  (str).")
print('This my \'text\' (str).')

# When we need only print, don't execute nothing more, we can use param 'r'
print(r"This my text with \n not break line")
